This Repository deals with React props and States.
Props: 
Basically Props stands for Properties. Mailny used when needed to pass data between components Dynamically.
This works to transfer data in one direction only.(Parent to Child)
Not in two-direction. (Not able to pass from Child to Parent, but there are other ways to transfer).

States:
React has another special built-in object called state, which allows components to create and manage their own data. So unlike props, components cannot pass data with state, but they can create and manage it internally.
